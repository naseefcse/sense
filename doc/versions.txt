- The TTL is no longer changed during the packet's life. In the previous code,
  the TTL was increased if the new expected HC + 4 > current TTL.

- Changed how SHR uses the MAC layer. IN the old code, SHR immediately sent
  packets that it was forwarding to the MAC layer where they waited on the
  defer queue until the back off time expired. During this time, the node
  couldn't send any other packets. Now, the node puts the packets on a delay
  list until the back off time expires at which time they are sent to the MAC
  layer. This required the addition of a new timer and list.

- Changed the name of several items:
  m_ack_queue -> m_ack_list   (it's not a queue)
  ack_timer   -> ackTimer
  mwlPrint    -> shrPrint
  SendPacket  -> AssignSeqNumber (The method SendPacket is new functionality.)

- The logic was swapped that controlled the number of destination nodes when
  the adjacency matrix channel was used.
